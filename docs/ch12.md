# 第 12 章 测试模块

> Chapter 12. Testing Modules
Building modular codebases also involves testing. The Java community has always fostered a strong culture of automated testing. Unit tests play a large role in Java software development.

What effect does the module system have on existing testing practices? We want to be able to test code inside modules. In this chapter, we look at two common scenarios:

Blackbox testing
Test modules from the outside. Blackbox tests exercise the public API of a module, without knowledge of internals (hence, the box is opaque). The tests can test either a single module or several modules at once. As such, you can also characterize these tests as integration tests for modules.

Whitebox testing
Test modules from the inside. Instead of taking the outside view, whitebox tests assume knowledge of the internals of a module. These tests are typically unit tests, testing a single class or method in isolation.

Although other testing scenarios are possible, these two cover a wide range of existing practices. Blackbox tests are more restricted in what they can test, but are also more stable because they exercise public APIs. Conversely, whitebox tests can test internal details more easily, at the risk of needing more maintenance.

The focus of this chapter is to highlight the interplay between testing and the module system. It is expected that build tools and IDEs will take care of a lot of the details described in this chapter. Still, it’s important to get a feeling for how testing scenarios play out with the module system in place.

For the remainder of this chapter, we assume the following module is under test:

easytext.syllablecounter
├── javamodularity
│   └── easytext
│       └── syllablecounter
│           ├── SimpleSyllableCounter.java
│           └── vowel
│               └── VowelHelper.java
└── module-info.java
The module descriptor of easytext.syllablecounter is as follows:

module easytext.syllablecounter {
  exports javamodularity.easytext.syllablecounter;
}
The package containing VowelHelper is not exported, whereas SimpleSyllableCounter is in an exported package. Internally, SimpleSyllableCounter uses VowelHelper to implement the syllable-counting algorithm. This distinction becomes important when moving from blackbox to whitebox testing.

In the following sections, we are going to look at what it takes to run both types of tests with modules.

Blackbox Tests
Let’s say we want to test the easytext.syllablecounter module. Rather than unit testing all internal details, we want to test the functional behavior of the module’s API. In this case, that means testing the public API as exposed by SimpleSyllableCounter. It has one public method, countSyllables.

The easiest way to do so is to create another module that requires easytext.syllablecounter, as shown in Figure 12-1. It is also possible to just put the module and its tests on the classpath. We don’t pursue this option here because we want the module to be tested as a module (i.e., including its module descriptor with requires and uses clauses), not just as some code on the classpath. In “Whitebox Tests”, where we look at testing the internals of modules, the classpath testing approach is shown.

Testing module `easytext.syllablecounter` with a separate `easytext.syllablecounter.test` module.
Figure 12-1. Testing module easytext.syllablecounter with a separate easytext.syllablecounter.test module
To start things slowly, we’re going to create a test without a testing framework first. Later, we’ll adapt the test to use JUnit, a popular unit-testing framework. Example 12-1 presents the code that performs the test, using standard Java asserts for verification purposes.

Example 12-1. Blackbox test for SimpleSyllableCounter (➥ chapter12/blackbox)
package javamodularity.easytext.test;

import javamodularity.easytext.syllablecounter.SimpleSyllableCounter;

public class TestSyllableCounter {

  public static void main(String... args) {
    SimpleSyllableCounter sc = new SimpleSyllableCounter();

    assert sc.countSyllables("Bike") == 1;
    assert sc.countSyllables("Motor") == 2;
    assert sc.countSyllables("Bicycle") == 3;

  }

}
This code is as simple as it can get: the main method instantiates the publicly exported SimpleSyllableCounter class and verifies its behavior by using asserts. The test class is placed in its own module with the following descriptor:

module easytext.syllablecounter.test {
  requires easytext.syllablecounter;
}
Then, it can be compiled and run as usual. We assume the module under test is already compiled in the out directory:

$ javac --module-path out \ 1
--module-source-path src-test -d out-test -m easytext.syllablecounter.test
$ java -ea --module-path out:out-test \ 2
-m easytext.syllablecounter.test/javamodularity.easytext.test.TestSyllableCounter 3
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.AssertionError
  at easytext.syllablecounter.test/javamodularity.easytext.test.
     TestSyllableCounter.main(TestSyllableCounter.java:12)
1
Compile the test with the module under test on the module path.

2
Run with assertions enabled (-ea) and with both the module under test and the test module on the module path.

3
Start the test module’s class containing the main method.

An AssertionError is thrown, because the naive syllable–counting algorithm chokes on the word Bicycle. That’s good, because it means we have a working blackbox test. Before we move on to introducing a test framework to run the test, let’s reflect on this blackbox-testing approach.

Testing a module this way has several advantages but also some drawbacks. An advantage of doing blackbox testing is that you can test a module in its natural habitat. You’re testing the module just as other modules would use it in the application. If, for example, the module under test would offer a service, this can be tested as well in this setup. Just add a uses constraint to the module descriptor of the test module, and load the service with ServiceLoader in the test.

On the other hand, testing a module this way means that only the exported parts can be tested directly. There’s no way to directly test, for example, the encapsulated VowelHelper class. Nor would any nonpublic parts of SimpleSyllableCounter be accessible.

NOTE
You could run the tests by using, for example, --add-exports or --add-opens flags to give the test module access to encapsulated parts.

Another limitation is that the test classes need to be in a different package than the classes under test. For unit tests in Java, it’s customary to put test classes in a different source folder but under the same package name. The goal of this setup is to be able to test elements that are package-private (e.g., a class without the public modifier). In the classpath situation, this was no problem. The packages would, as it were, merge when running the tests. However, two modules containing the same package cannot be loaded in the boot layer (as discussed in “Classloading in Layers”).

Last, all dependencies of the module under test and the test module itself must be satisfied. If easytext.syllablecounter had other modules it required, those would need to be on the module path as well. Of course, it’s possible to create mock modules in those situations. Instead of putting the actual module dependency on the module path, you can create a new module with the same name, containing just enough code to get the test running. Whether you want to do this depends on the scope of the test. Running it with actual modules makes it more of an integration test, whereas running the test with mock modules offers more isolation and control.

Blackbox Tests with JUnit
At this point, we can run test code against easytext.syllablecounter from a separate test module. Writing tests using plain asserts in a main method isn’t really what you’d expect from tests in Java, though. To fix that, we’re going to rewrite the test to use JUnit 4, as shown in Example 12-2.

Example 12-2. JUnit test for SimpleSyllableCounter (➥ chapter12/blackbox)
package javamodularity.easytext.test;

import org.junit.Test;
import javamodularity.easytext.syllablecounter.SimpleSyllableCounter;

import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class JUnitTestSyllableCounter {

   private SimpleSyllableCounter counter = new SimpleSyllableCounter();

   @Test
   public void testSyllableCounter() {
      assertEquals(1, counter.countSyllables("Bike"));
      assertEquals(2, counter.countSyllables("Motor"));
      assertEquals(3, counter.countSyllables("Bicycle"));
   }

}
The test module now has a dependency on JUnit. At run-time, the JUnit test runner will reflectively load our test class to execute the unit-test methods. For this to work, the test package must be exported or opened. An open module suffices:

open module easytext.syllablecounter.junit {
  requires easytext.syllablecounter;
  requires junit;
}
Figure 12-2 shows the new situation, adding JUnit to the mix.

The `easytext.syllablecounter.junit` module depends on the (automatic) module `junit`.
Figure 12-2. The easytext.syllablecounter.junit module depends on the (automatic) module junit
To make this work, we put the JUnit JAR (and its Hamcrest dependency) in a lib folder:

lib
├── hamcrest-core-1.3.jar
└── junit-4.12.jar
Then, JUnit can be used as an automatic module by putting the lib folder on the module path. The derived module names are junit and hamcrest.core.

As before, we assume the easytext.syllablecounter module is available in the out folder:

$ javac --module-path out:lib \ 1
        --module-source-path src-test -d out-test -m easytext.syllablecounter.junit
$ java --module-path out:lib:out-test \
       -m junit/org.junit.runner.JUnitCore \ 2
          javamodularity.easytext.test.JUnitTestSyllableCounter

JUnit version 4.12

.E
Time: 0,002
There was 1 failure:
1) initializationError(org.junit.runner.JUnitCommandLineParseResult)
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Could not find class
[javamodularity.easytext.test.JUnitTestSyllableCounter]
1
Compile the test with the module under test and JUnit (as an automatic module) on the module path.

2
Start the JUnitCore test runner from the JUnit (automatic) module.

Running the test is done using the JUnitCore runner class, part of JUnit. It’s a simple console-based test runner, where we provide the classname of the test class as a command-line argument. Unfortunately, running the unit test ends in an unexpected exception, saying the JUnitTestSyllableCounter class can’t be found by JUnit. Why can it not find the test class? We made the module open so that JUnit can access it at run-time, after all.

The problem is that the test module is never resolved. JUnit is used as the root module for starting the runner. Because it is an automatic module, the other automatic module (hamcrest.core) on the module path gets resolved as well. However, junit does not require easytext.syllablecounter.junit, the module containing our test. Only at run-time does JUnit try to load the test class from the test module using reflection. That doesn’t work, because the easytext.syllablecounter.junit module is never resolved by the module system at startup, even though it is on the module path.

To resolve the test module as well, we can define an --add-modules statement when starting the test runner:

$ java --module-path out:lib:out-test \
       --add-modules easytext.syllablecounter.junit \
       -m junit/org.junit.runner.JUnitCore \
          javamodularity.easytext.test.JUnitTestSyllableCounter

JUnit version 4.12
.E
Time: 0,005
There was 1 failure:
1) testSyllableCounter(javamodularity.easytext.test.JUnitTestSyllableCounter)
java.lang.AssertionError: expected:<3> but was:<1>
Now we get a legitimate test failure, meaning JUnit was able to run our test class.

We’ve extended our blackbox test to use an external test framework. Because JUnit 4.12 is not modularized, it has to be used as an automatic module. Running the test through JUnit is possible only if the test module is resolved and our test class is accessible at run-time.

Whitebox Tests
Now, what if we want to test VowelHelper as well? It’s a public, but nonexported class with a public method isVowel and a package-private method getVowels. Unit testing this class means crossing from blackbox testing to whitebox testing.

Access to the encapsulated VowelHelper class is necessary. Also, when we want to test package-private functionality, we need our test classes to be in the same package. How can we get these capabilities in a modular setup? Using --add-exports or --add-opens to expose types for testing works to a limited extent. If test classes need to be in the same package as the classes under test, a package clash between the test module and the module to be tested arises.

There are two major approaches to solving this problem. Which one will be the best in practice remains to be seen. Again, it’s mostly up to the build tools and IDEs to lead the way here. We’ll examine both approaches, to get a feeling for the underlying mechanisms at play:

Using the classpath for tests

Patching modules by injecting tests

The first approach is the most straightforward, because it mostly builds on what was always happening:

package javamodularity.easytext.syllablecounter.vowel;

import org.junit.Test;
import javamodularity.easytext.syllablecounter.vowel.VowelHelper;

import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertTrue;

public class JUnitTestVowelHelper {

   @Test
   public void testIsVowel() {
      assertTrue(VowelHelper.isVowel('e'));
   }

   @Test
   public void testGetVowels() {
      assertEquals(5, VowelHelper.getVowels().size());
   }

}
We can test encapsulated code in a compiled module by not treating it as a module at test-time. Modules placed on the classpath behave as if they have no module descriptor in the first place. Furthermore, split packages between JARs on the classpath do not pose any issues. If the test class is then compiled outside a module as well, things work remarkably well:

$ javac -cp lib/junit-4.12.jar:out/easytext.syllablecounter \
        -d out-test $(find . -name '*.java')

$ java -cp lib/junit-4.12.jar:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:\
           out/easytext.syllablecounter:out-test \
        org.junit.runner.JUnitCore \
        javamodularity.easytext.syllablecounter.vowel.JUnitTestVowelHelper
JUnit version 4.12
..
Time: 0,004

OK (2 tests)
Of course, using the classpath means we don’t benefit from automatic resolving of modules. Dependencies declared in the module descriptor are not resolved, because a module on the classpath behaves as a regular, nonmodular JAR. The classpath needs to be constructed manually. Also, any service provides/uses clauses in the module descriptor of the module under test are ignored. So, even though the classpath-based testing approach works, it has several drawbacks. Ultimately, it seems better to test a module as a module, and not as though it were a nonmodular JAR.

There’s a way to keep the module structure intact, while at the same time creating a test class in the same package. Through a feature called module patching, new classes can be added to an existing module.

Creating a whitebox unit test within the same module and package works as follows. First, the test class needs to be compiled with the --patch-module flag:

$ javac --patch-module easytext.syllablecounter=src-test \ 1
        --module-path lib:out \
        --add-modules junit \ 2
        --add-reads easytext.syllablecounter=junit \ 3
        -d out-test $(find src-test -name '*.java')
1
The test sources are compiled as if they were part of the easytext.syllablecounter module. There’s no module descriptor for the test code.

2
Because there’s no test module descriptor to require junit, it must be added explicitly.

3
With the test class added to easytext.syllablecounter, this module must now read junit. There’s no requires clause in the original module descriptor for that, so --add-reads is necessary.

By patching a module, we can compile the unit-test class as part of the already compiled easytext.syllablecounter module. Because the test lives in the same package, it can invoke the package-private getVowels method.

Making the test class part of the easytext.syllablecounter module on the fly does pose some challenges. Steps must be taken to ensure that the module now reads junit. At run-time, junit must be able to access the test class in a nonexported package. That leads to the following, quite impressive, java invocation:

$ java --patch-module easytext.syllablecounter=out-test \ 1
  --add-reads easytext.syllablecounter=junit \ 2
  --add-opens \ 3
  easytext.syllablecounter/javamodularity.easytext.syllablecounter.vowel=junit \
  --module-path lib:out \
  --add-modules easytext.syllablecounter \ 4
  -m junit/org.junit.runner.JUnitCore \
     javamodularity.easytext.syllablecounter.vowel.JUnitTestVowelHelper

JUnit version 4.12
..
Time: 0,004

OK (2 tests)
1
At run-time, the module must be patched with the compiled test class.

2
As during compilation, the module needs to read junit, which is not expressed in the module descriptor.

3
Because junit reflectively instantiates JUnitTestVowelHelper, its containing package needs to be opened or exported to junit.

4
As before, junit is the initial module and doesn’t require easytext.syllablecounter, so it must be added explicitly.

Unlike with the compiler invocation, there is no need to have --add-modules junit. JUnit is used as root module to run, and is therefore already resolved.

In Figure 12-3, you can see the whole picture of what patching a module to run unit tests entails.

The `JUnitTestVowelHelper` class (in the same package as `VowelHelper`) is patched into the `easytext.syllablecounter` module.
Figure 12-3. The JUnitTestVowelHelper class (in the same package as VowelHelper) is patched into the easytext.syllablecounter module
This second approach has quite a few moving parts. On the upside, all features of the module are taken into account at test-time as well. The module’s dependencies are resolved, and uses/provides clauses are taken into account. On the downside, setting up all the correct command-line flags seems like a lot of wizardry. Even though we could explain why everything needs to be done this way, it’s still a lot to take in.

In practice, setting up all the intricate details for unit-testing scenarios shouldn’t be up to developers. Build tools and development environments offer their own test runners for most of the popular testing frameworks. These runners should take care of setting up the environment such that tests are automatically patched into modules.

PATCHING MODULES FOR OTHER REASONS
There are other scenarios besides running unit tests for which patching modules is convenient. For example, for debugging purposes, you may want to add or replace classes in an existing module. Both classes and resources can be patched into a module. The only thing that cannot be replaced is the module descriptor.

The --patch-module flag also works for platform modules. So, technically, you can (re)place classes in the package java.lang in the java.base module. Module patching replaces -Xbootclasspath:/p, a feature which is dropped in JDK 9.

Using the module-patching feature for production scenarios is highly discouraged.

Test Tooling
Test frameworks such as JUnit and TestNG are well supported by IDEs as well as build tools. Typically, they are used to write and run whitebox unit-tests. Most tools are currently taking the classpath route to run tests, even when code includes a module descriptor. This way, the module descriptor is basically ignored, as is strong encapsulation. Because of this, tests run the same way you’re used to. This also keeps compatibility with existing project structures, where the application code and test code are in different folders but in the same package structure.

If code is relying on services using the new keywords in module descriptors, this will not automatically work on the classpath. Then, the blackbox testing scenario described in this chapter is more appropriate. There is no specific support for these scenarios in the current versions of test frameworks. It is to be expected that new tools, or support in existing tools, will be created to help with testing modules following the strategies in this chapter.
