# 第 14 章 模块化的未来

> Chapter 14. A Modular Future

We’re nearing the end of our journey through the Java module system—starting from the modular JDK, all the way through creating your own modules and migrating existing code to modules. On the one hand, there’s a lot of new functionality around modules to take in. On the other hand, Java modules simply encourage tried-and-true best practices around modular development.

Using modules for new code is recommended except for the smallest of applications. Applying strong encapsulation and managing explicit dependencies from the start lays a solid foundation for maintainable systems. It also unlocks new capabilities such as creating a custom runtime image with jlink.

Entering the modular future of Java requires adherence to the principles of modularity. When your existing applications have a modular design, the transition will be smooth. Many people already use multimodule Maven or Gradle builds for their applications. Often these existing module boundaries map naturally to Java modules. In some cases, the ServiceLoader mechanism offered by the JDK is a good alternative to using a full-blown dependency injection framework.

However, when your applications are anything but modular, the transition will be challenging.

You saw in earlier chapters that it is certainly possible to migrate existing applications to modules. When their design is lacking in modularity, though, you effectively take on two problems at the same time during migration. The first is untangling the architecture so that it conforms to the principles of modularity. The second is the actual migration to Java 9 and its module system.

Whether it is worth to take on this effort is a trade-off that cannot be captured in a general guideline. It depends on the scope of the system, expected lifetime, and many other context-dependent variables. Note that even the massive JDK succeeded in modularizing itself, although that took years of hard work. Clearly, where there’s a will, there’s a way. Whether the benefits outweigh the costs is the main question to be answered for existing codebases. There is no shame in leaving an application on the classpath.

In the remainder of this chapter, we take stock of the Java module system in the existing landscape of modular development approaches.

OSGi
Long before the Java module system, other module systems emerged. These existing systems offer application-level modularity only, whereas the Java module system also modularizes the platform itself. The oldest and most well-known existing module system is OSGi. It offers run-time modularity by running bundles (JARs with OSGi wiring metadata) in an OSGi container. Isolation between bundles is achieved by controlling visibility of classes through a clever arrangement of classloaders. Essentially, each bundle is loaded by its own, isolated classloader, delegating only to other classloaders based on the bundle’s metadata. Isolation through classloaders happens only at run-time inside the OSGi container. At build-time, development tools such as Bndtools or Eclipse PDE must be used to enforce strong encapsulation and dependencies.

Does OSGi become obsolete with the introduction of the Java module system? Far from it. First of all, existing OSGi applications can keep running on Java 9 by using the classpath. When you have an OSGi-based system, there’s no rush to make your bundles into Java modules. Also, the OSGi Alliance is doing preliminary work on interoperability between OSGi bundles and Java modules.

The question then becomes: when to use OSGi and when to use the Java module system for new systems? To answer that question, it’s important to understand how OSGi and the Java module system differ.

There are some notable differences between OSGi and the Java module system:

Package dependencies
OSGi bundles express dependencies on packages, not directly on other bundles (though this is possible as well). The OSGi resolver wires together bundles based on the exported and imported packages given in the bundle metadata. This makes a bundle’s name less important than a Java module name. Bundles export at the package level, just like Java modules.

Versioning
Unlike modules in Java, OSGi has versions for both bundles and packages. Dependencies can be expressed on exact versions or version ranges. Because each bundle is loaded in a separate classloader, multiple versions of a bundle can coexist, although this is not without caveats.

Dynamic loading
Bundles can be loaded, unloaded, started, and stopped inside an OSGi runtime. There are callbacks for these bundle life-cycle events, since bundles must cope with this dynamic environment. Java modules can be loaded at run-time in ModuleLayers, and be garbage collected later. In contrast with OSGi bundles, no explicit life-cycle callbacks are defined for Java modules, because a more static configuration is assumed.

Dynamic services
OSGi also defines a services mechanism with a central service registry. The API for OSGi services is richer than what is offered by Java’s ServiceLoader. High-level frameworks (such as Declarative Services) are offered on top of basic OSGi services. OSGi services can come and go at run-time, not in the least because bundles offering them can come and go dynamically. Java services with ServiceLoader are wired once during module resolution. Only with ModuleLayer can new services be introduced at run-time. Unlike OSGi services, they do not support start and stop callbacks.

A repeating theme across these differences is that OSGi supports more-dynamic scenarios in its runtime. OSGi has more features in this regard than the Java module system. This is partly because OSGi’s roots are in embedded systems. Zero downtime updates are possible because OSGi bundles can be hot-swapped. New hardware can be plugged in, and services supporting them can be dynamically started.

In enterprise software, this same paradigm can extend to other resources with dynamic availability at run-time. If you need these dynamics, OSGi is the way to go. OSGi’s dynamic life cycle does add some complexity for developers. Part of this inherent complexity can be abstracted away during development by using higher-level frameworks such as Declarative Services. In practice, many applications (including those using OSGi) tend to wire together services at startup, without any dynamic changes afterward. In those cases, the Java module system offers enough functionality out of the box.

Tooling around OSGi has been a source of frustration to many developers. It just doesn’t have the critical mass behind it to get full attention of the community and vendors, even after more than a decade. With modules being part of the Java platform, vendors are already creating tooling and support ahead of its release. Because the OSGi framework is in action only at run-time, tooling has to mimic its rules during development. Java’s module system rules are enforced at all stages in a consistent manner, from development to run-time.

The Java module system also has features that are not in OSGi, mostly around migration to modules. There’s no direct OSGi equivalent of automatic modules. Not all Java libraries offer (correct) OSGi metadata, meaning patches or pull requests are the only means of using those libraries with OSGi. Libraries sometimes also contain code that doesn’t play nice with OSGi’s isolated classloading setup. In the Java module system, classloading is implemented in a more backward-compatible manner. Because the Java module system doesn’t use classloaders for isolation, it offers stronger encapsulation. A whole new mechanism based on accessibility and readability is enforced deep within the JVM.

Time will tell whether adoption of the Java module system will be higher. Because modules are now part of the Java platform itself, we fully expect the Java community to take modularization seriously.

Java EE
Modules are a Java SE feature. Many developers, however, develop Java EE applications. In Java EE, Web Archives (WARs) and Enterprise Archives (EARs) bundle JAR files with deployment descriptors. These Java EE applications are then deployed onto application servers.

How will Java EE evolve, given modules are now part of the Java platform? It’s fair to assume that at some point the Java EE specification will embrace modules. At the moment, it’s too early to tell what this will look like. The Java EE 8 release builds on Java SE 8. So modules and Java EE meet at the earliest in Java EE 9, for which no release date is set. Until this convergence, Java EE application servers can keep on using the classpath as before.

You already saw in “Container Architectures” that in principle, the module system has features to support application containers such as Java EE application servers. What modular Java EE applications will look like remains to be seen. For applications, Java EE modularity could be a form of modular WAR or EAR files, or something completely new.

A good first step would be to publish the Java EE APIs as modules with standardized names. The official JAX-RS API distribution already has a module descriptor. With modules, it becomes even more attractive to regard Java EE as a loosely related set of specifications. Maybe there’s no need to wait for monolithic application servers to support a full suite of specifications at once. When you can require just the parts of Java EE you need, new doors open. Keep in mind, though, this is all speculation based on what could be, not what is.

Microservices
In the past few years, microservices have gained prominence as an architectural style. One of the cited benefits of microservices is that they enable modular development. By dividing a system into independently deployable and runnable parts, the system is modularized. Each microservice runs as an independent process. Multiple microservices can even be written in completely different technologies. They communicate over the network by using standard protocols such as HTTP and gRPC.

Indeed, this architectural style inherently enforces strong module boundaries. How do microservices fare on the other two principles of modularity, well-defined interfaces and explicit dependencies? Interfaces between microservices fall on a spectrum from rigidly defined in an Interface Definition Language (IDL) such as Protocol Buffers, RAML, or even WSDL/SOAP, to unspecified JSON over HTTP. Dependencies between microservices typically arise by dynamic discovery at run-time. Not many microservices stacks offer statically verifiable dependencies akin to requires in module descriptors.

In this book, you have seen that modularity can be achieved without resorting to process isolation. Using the Java module system, strong encapsulation and explicit dependencies between modules can be enforced by the Java compiler and JVM. Use of Java interfaces and services with their explicit provides/uses wiring in the module system completes this modular development approach. Viewed from this perspective, microservices are somewhat like modules with a network boundary in between. But these network boundaries turn a microservices system into a distributed system with all the associated drawbacks. When you choose microservices solely for their modularity characteristics, think twice. Using Java modules for your system brings similar (or even stronger) modularity benefits, without the operational complexity of a microservices architecture.

To be fair, there are many reasons why microservices can be a good choice, besides the argument for modularity. Think of independent updates and scaling of services, or when using different technology stacks per service really is beneficial. Then again, choosing between modules or microservices doesn’t have to be either/or. Modules can create a strong internal structure for a microservice implementation, allowing it to scale beyond what you would typically ascribe to micro. It’s quite sensible to initially develop a system with modules, while at a later stage extracting some of those modules into their own microservices when operational concerns demand it.

Next Steps
We’ve discussed several alternative approaches to modularization and how they relate to the Java module system. The hard part still lies in correctly decomposing the domain of your application, regardless of what technique you use to do so. Java modules are another powerful tool in the toolbox to create well-structured systems.

Is the current state of the module system perfect? Nothing is, and the module system is no exception. Adding a module system this late in the Java platform’s life cycle inevitably led to compromises. Still, Java 9 lays a solid foundation to build upon. Sure, it would be great to address issues such as running multiple versions of a module at the same time besides what’s currently possible with ModuleLayer. The fact that this is not currently supported on the module path doesn’t mean it will never be. For other features, the same holds. The module system is not done and will almost certainly gain new powers in subsequent releases. For now, it is up to the Java ecosystem and tool vendors to support modular Java.

As the Java community starts to embrace the module system, more libraries will become available as modules. This makes it easier to embrace modules in your own applications, although we have seen that automatic modules are an acceptable interim solution. To get started, it makes sense to gain experience with the module system in a greenfield setting. Build a small application consisting of a handful of modules, like the EasyText application you’ve seen throughout this book. This gives you a good feel for what a cleanly modularized application looks like. With this experience under your belt, you can take on a more ambitious step, such as modularizing one of your existing applications.

Having a module system as part of the Java platform is a game-changer. No, this is not something that will happen overnight. It will take considerable time for the Java community to embrace the concepts of the Java module system. That’s just the nature of the beast: modularity is not a quick fix or new feature you can slap onto existing codebases. Yet the advantages of modularity are evident. The renewed attention for modularity through microservices illustrates that most people intuitively grasp this. With the module system, Java developers gain new options for building maintainable large-scale systems.

You now have learned the concepts of the Java module system. More important, you know the principles behind modularity and how to apply them by using the module system. Now it’s time to use this knowledge in practice. May your software have a modular future!
